# Ember Macro Benchmark Blueprint

Blueprint for creating configuration for ember-macro-benchmark

To run, check out locally, and in the parent of the repo, to use the blue, run the following:
`ember new my-bench -b ./ember-macro-benchmark-blueprint/blueprints/\@ember-macro-benchmark/emb-blueprint`

Very WIP, part of https://github.com/krisselden/ember-macro-benchmark/issues/27
